# Introduction

Welcome to `qAlgorithms`, a comprehensive collection of C++ libraries designed specifically for processing analytical data. Our focus is on the non-target screening data domain, ensuring precise and reliable data processing for this complex field.

## Philosophy
Unlike many traditional data processing tools, our algorithms do not rely on manual user input parameters such as thresholds. Instead, they intelligently leverage the inherent properties of the measurement data itself. This approach allows the algorithms to dynamically assess and utilize the quality of the data, ensuring robust and reproducible results every time.

## Scientific Rigor
Our commitment to scientific validity is unwavering. The algorithms within `qAlgorithms` are rooted in well-established statistical tests. Our primary goal is to deliver results that aren't just accurate but also statistically significant, providing confidence in every analysis.

## Current Offerings

### qCentroids Algorithm
Our current flagship algorithm, `qCentroids` by Reuschenbach, Renner et al. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-022-04224-y], is tailored for centroiding HRMS spectra. It excels in handling data from instruments like Orbitrap and TOF, converting their profile spectra into centroided data. Whether you're dealing with high-resolution mass spectrometry data or other analytical measurements, `qCentroids` offers a reliable solution without the usual hassles of parameter tweaks.

## Future Roadmap
Our team is continuously researching and developing new algorithms to expand the capabilities of `qAlgorithms`. Stay tuned for more innovative solutions for analytical data processing!
